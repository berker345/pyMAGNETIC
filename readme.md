Python - Based Multiobjective Algorithm and Genetic Network for Electrical Machine Technology Integrating Computation
or pyMAGNETICS for short
(chatGPT came up with the name)

The goal of this project is to create a code that automates the free finite element based software FEMM to calculate the characteristics and optimize electrical machines.
My focus for the time being lies in the field of permanent magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs), with both radial and axial flux topologies.
